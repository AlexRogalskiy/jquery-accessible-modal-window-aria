# jQuery Simple and Accessible Modal Window

This jQuery plugin provides you a shiny and accessible modal window, using ARIA.

A presentation page and demo is here: http://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/modal/

## How it works

Basically, when you activate one, the scripts inserts a <code>dialog</code> element at the end of your page, put the focus into it and traps focus into the modal window. When you exit it, the focus is given back to the element that opened it.

For mouse users, they can click outside the modal window to close it. For keyboard users, you can strike Esc to close it.

If you never activate a modal window, it wonâ€™t be anywhere in the code.

## Options and attributes

Simply put class="js-modal" on a button or a link to activate the script.

- Attribute <code>data-modal-text</code>: the text of your modal window (will be put into a p tag).
- Attribute <code>data-modal-content-id</code>: the id of a (hidden) content in your page, will be put into your modal window.
- Attribute <code>data-modal-title</code>: the main title of the modal window.
- Attribute <code>data-modal-close-text</code>: the text of the close button in your modal window.
- Attribute <code>data-modal-close-title</code>: the title attribute of the close button in your modal window.

Enjoy.
